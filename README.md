## Master's thesis:
Robust and fast transformer-based models for bio-medical data
--------------------




This thesis is based on [Prior-Data Fitted Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10510) and aims to develop a PFN for the classification of imbalanced, bio-medical data in the context of predicting the presence of colorectal cancer from the gut microbiome profiles of patients. Main contributions are:
* Novel dataset prior using Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution in order to generate synthetic classification datasets with compositional features
* Curriculum training regime for PFNs designed to improve performance on highly imbalanced classification tasks
* Adapted several interpretable machine learning methods to PFNs and compositional data

Thesis was conducted in cooperation with the M3 research center in TÃ¼bingen. **Final grade: 1.3**
